An online editor in the making in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 

Currently:

Displays a normal text editor. Made in accordance with [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/). Using [monogjs](http://mafintosh.github.io/mongojs/) for [monogodb](http://www.mongodb.org/).

To run locally:
```
npm install
```
This installs all the necessary dependencies. Make sure you install ALL the dependencies before proceeding.

As a database, mongodb has been used. So, you'll need to start mongodb in a terminal.
Open a new terminal and start your mongodb server
```
mongod
```
Now you are ready to run:
```
node app.js
```

Visit on your favorite browser:

localhost:1992
